Blogging can seem like a funny thing to do if you are just starting out and you don't feel like you have a lot to share. To me though that is the perfect reason to start blogging. Learning is a journey and it has to start somewhere. Your developer blog is a record of that journey. **You blog not because you're the expert, but because you're on a journey.** It's the record of your trip.

Everyone is on some sort of journey. Whether it's sinking deeper into the couch cushions becoming a mindless zombie, or engaging in learning how to build new things. I've done a little of both and I can tell you from experience that learning is much more fun than watching four seasons of some show on Netflix.

Other people that are journeying will learn from you and you'll learn from them. Along the way you'll make lots of mistakes and have your fair share of failures, but in the process you'll grow. Here are my top 3 reasons why you should blog as you learn to develop software:

## 1. Learning is Gradual

Most of the time learning is slow and arduous. When you are learning it's tough to see the forest for the trees. It's easy to feel like you aren't making progress, because you are moving slow. However, that slow and steady pace will help you travel far. Your blog helps you see how far you have progressed. Periodically it's good to look back at earlier posts to get an idea of how the journey is going.

## 2. It's Easy to Forget

Occasionally you have one of those eureka momenets. Those are great. Nothing beats that feeling when it clicks, and you feel like you can do anything. You know you've learned something. Unfortunately you often forget the learning from those moments.

It's also easy to forget what that feels like when you are stuck. There are going to be times when nothing works. Your blog will be a good reminder that there are good and bad days, but they are all part of the journey. Sometimes we have to backtrack, but it's always helping us grow.

## 3. It Keeps You Accountable

Sometimes it's easy to take a shortcut and just get the code working. However, the goal of learning software development is to learn the skills and concepts necessary to effectively solve future problems. If you skip the learning, then you really are just hurting yourself.

It's like using cheat codes. You may beat the level today, but the next level doesn't get any easier. Life doesn't give you cheat codes, so put in the work and reflect on what you are learning. Your blog is a way for you to be accountable for your learning. Did you get it to work; or did you get it to work and know why it works?

## Conclusion

There are many more reasons to write a developer blog. As you start with your blog, take some time to explore other developer blogs that are out there. You'll start seeing how other developers use their blogs and learn some formats for blog posts that you could replicate.
